Scoped Resource Controller-Adding a Review:
in this topic , I would like to add a review for a book.
but as known the Review can't be exist without a book to make reviews on it.
so there's a relation which is connect them together to be one Entity.
Also in routing the route must will be changed, in this seciton we gonna learn more about:

**Scoping Resource Routes**
Laravel's scoped implicit model binding feature can automatically
scope nested bindings such that the resolved child model is confirmed to belong to the parent model.
By using the scoped method when defining your nested resource,
you may enable automatic scoping as well as instruct Laravel on which field the child resource should be retrieved by
Ex:
{
use App\Http\Controllers\PhotoCommentController;
 
Route::resource('photos.comments', PhotoCommentController::class)->scoped([
    'comment' => 'slug',
]);
}
This route will register a scoped nested resource

that may be accessed with URIs like the following:
{
/photos/{photo}/comments/{comment:slug}
}

BTW: Laravel can figure out the relation between The Book and Reviews Because we told
Laravel that Book has many Reviews
